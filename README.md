# kapa-interview-service

This repository contains a monolithic RAG application. This service is not real but it was written with the real `kapa.ai` system in mind. It is identical in its technologies used but it is much smaller in scale and all its core implementations have been replaced by dummy code to reduce external dependencies.

You can see some deployed examples of the real kapa [here](https://docs.kapa.ai/examples).
